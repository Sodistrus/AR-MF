## Platform topology & distributed runtime hardening

**Owner highlights**
- **CNR-CRN** drove a major infrastructure expansion that moved the runtime toward multi-service production topology (API gateway, WS gateway, governor, messaging bootstraps, and k8s deployment manifests). This bundled deployment assets, service Dockerfiles, and distributed gateway changes to make horizontal deployment patterns explicit and reproducible. [#102](https://github.com/Aetherium-Syndicate-Inspectra/Aetherium-Manifest/pull/102), [#101](https://github.com/Aetherium-Syndicate-Inspectra/Aetherium-Manifest/pull/101), [#100](https://github.com/Aetherium-Syndicate-Inspectra/Aetherium-Manifest/pull/100), [#99](https://github.com/Aetherium-Syndicate-Inspectra/Aetherium-Manifest/pull/99), [#98](https://github.com/Aetherium-Syndicate-Inspectra/Aetherium-Manifest/pull/98)

**Narrative**
- The team shifted from prototype-local assumptions toward production deployment primitives: explicit service separation, queue/messaging bootstrap artifacts, and region-aware architecture documentation.
- Gateway and websocket scaling work indicates focus on high connection density and operational reliability under sustained load.
- Documentation updates in this stream are not cosmetic; they track architecture decisions and are now aligned to concrete deployable assets.

## Contract/governor/runtime alignment

**Owner highlights**
- **CNR-CRN** improved gateway and governor integration by splitting websocket service responsibilities, publishing approved envelopes, and loading runtime ABI paths through the canonical control boundary. [#108](https://github.com/Aetherium-Syndicate-Inspectra/Aetherium-Manifest/pull/108), [#105](https://github.com/Aetherium-Syndicate-Inspectra/Aetherium-Manifest/pull/105), [#103](https://github.com/Aetherium-Syndicate-Inspectra/Aetherium-Manifest/pull/103)

**Narrative**
- This workstream reinforces the repository’s state-first and governor-first architecture: schema and runtime control are being wired into deployment/runtime paths instead of staying as docs-only assumptions.
- The added schema ConfigMap mount and rollout checksum strategy reduce drift risk between declared contract and live governor behavior.
- README/runtime model alignment suggests active cleanup to keep implementation and contract language coherent.

## Helm packaging, autoscaling policy, and release automation

**Owner highlights**
- **CNR-CRN** established an umbrella Helm chart, then iteratively added HPA templates, ingress split, and environment overlays for dev/prod; CI checks were expanded to validate autoscaling defaults and SDLC policy flows. [#111](https://github.com/Aetherium-Syndicate-Inspectra/Aetherium-Manifest/pull/111), [#110](https://github.com/Aetherium-Syndicate-Inspectra/Aetherium-Manifest/pull/110), [#109](https://github.com/Aetherium-Syndicate-Inspectra/Aetherium-Manifest/pull/109), [#106](https://github.com/Aetherium-Syndicate-Inspectra/Aetherium-Manifest/pull/106), [#104](https://github.com/Aetherium-Syndicate-Inspectra/Aetherium-Manifest/pull/104)

**Narrative**
- The chart work matured from scaffold to policy-aware deploy controls in less than a day: HPAs per service, ingress route separation, and value overlays indicate immediate operational intent rather than template-only setup.
- Delivery ownership is being clarified through deployment docs and environment overlays, with execution mode controlled outside repository automation.
- CI additions around HPA defaults and workflow labeling indicate growing emphasis on governance and repeatability alongside raw feature velocity.

## Risks / watch items

- Fast operational expansion can create contract drift unless runtime ABI checks remain mandatory in CI and in release gates.
- Multiple deployment surfaces (raw k8s + Helm + cloud workflow) increase maintenance overhead; ownership boundaries should stay explicit.
- Some commits include generated/cache artifacts in source control history; this may increase noise for future reviews.
